*A Product Manager's Perspective on the Essence of Entertainment, Zero-Sum Games, and Future Forms*

As a product manager entrenched in the short-form video sector, my existence is torn between two extremes. By day, I fixate on DAU (Daily Active Users), Retention, and Average Duration, attempting to algorithmically fill every vacant second of a user's life. By night, masquerading as an occasional Creator, I stare anxiously at completion rates, pondering how to hook a bored soul sitting on a toilet within the first three seconds.

In this era of rampant AI acceleration, whether it's Netflix, TikTok, Activision Blizzard, or Tesla building humanoid robots, everyone seems locked in a silent war.

Some call this a **Zero-Sum Game**, because God is fair and gives everyone only 24 hours; others say we are **Growing the Pie**, because AI is redefining what it means to "play."

As an insider, today I want to step outside the KPIs and discuss the endgame of this war, and the very essence of entertainment.

---

## I. The Battlefield: From "Content Finds People" to "Content Creates People"

For a long time, the logic of the entertainment industry was "distribute the best content to the most suitable people." This was the secret to ByteDance's rise and the golden decade of recommendation algorithms. But in the AI era, specifically with the maturation of Generative AI, a nuclear explosion has occurred on the supply side.

### 1. Infinite Supply & Zero Marginal Cost

Previously, filming *Avatar* took years and hundreds of millions of dollars; today, Sora or Runway can generate photorealistic scenes in minutes. For platforms, the cost of content production is asymptotically approaching zero.

> **Insight:** When content is no longer scarce, the only thing left scarce is the "will to choose."

### 2. "N of 1" Hyper-Customization

Silicon Valley VC firm a16z introduced the concept of "Just-for-you content." The future of entertainment isn't millions of people watching the same show, but AI generating a show specifically for *you* in real-time. If you want to see "Harry Potter riding a Nimbus 2000 in Cyberpunk Tokyo," AI will stream it for you the next second.

> **Paradigm Shift:** We are moving from "Segmentation" (Recommendation) to "Personal Worlds" (Generation).

---

## II. Zero-Sum Game or Growing the Pie?

This is the industry's most debated question.

### 1. The Pessimist's "Zero-Sum" View: Netflix vs. Sleep

Nobel laureate Herbert Simon long ago proposed the "Attention Economy": *a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.*

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once famously remarked, *"We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO... sleep is our competition."*

From the dimension of physical time, this is absolutely a zero-sum game. If you're scrolling TikTok, you aren't gaming; if you're on YouTube, you aren't reading. Every major app is engaged in hand-to-hand combat within this "24-hour" red ocean, attempting to hijack your brain via dopamine loops.

### 2. The Optimist's "Pie-Growing" View: Intensity & Context Expansion

However, I lean towards the view that in the value dimension, we are growing the pie. There are two reasons:

- **Intensity of Entertainment:** Previously, we endured 5 minutes of boring setup for 1 minute of thrill. Short videos, micro-dramas, and future AI games compress "gratification points." Time remains constant, but the *Total Emotional Value* the user receives rises exponentially.
- **Context Expansion:** With the ubiquity of autonomous driving and lightweight AR/VR (like Apple Vision Pro), commute times and chore times will be converted. When your hands and eyes are freed, or when you have an embodied robot as a playmate, "dead time" becomes "live time."

> **Conclusion:** Time is zero-sum, but the depth and breadth of experience are an infinite game.

---

## III. Future Disruptions: Three Revolutionary Forms

If we look further ahead, what entertainment revolutions will AI and hardware advancements bring?

**Interactive Narrative**
No longer passive consumption, but being "in" the story. Future top IPs will be "living, growing worldviews."

**Emotional Outsourcing**
From Character.ai to Tesla Optimus, "socializing" will become an entertainment product mass-produced by algorithms.

**Brain-Computer Interface**
When entertainment no longer requires eyes or ears, we reach the ultimate "Metaverse"—pure consciousness experience.

---

## IV. The Essence of Entertainment: What Are We Searching For?

As a product manager, I know that behind every feature lies human nature. In the AI era, the form of entertainment changes, but the essence remains constant.

I believe humanity's thirst for entertainment stems from deficits on three levels:

1. **Escapism (Fleeing Reality):**
   Reality is heavy, filled with uncertainty and frustration. Entertainment provides a sanctuary of low cost, high certainty, and immediate feedback.

2. **Connection (Desire for Contact):**
   Whether it's fireside chats of old, or today's bullet comments (danmu) and MMORPGs, we entertain ourselves to confirm we are not alone.

3. **Meaning Making (Simulating Significance):**
   Great entertainment (like *Lord of the Rings* or *The Three-Body Problem*) provides a grand narrative, allowing us to feel a sense of sublimity and mission in a void universe.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** AI will amplify the first two (Escapism & Connection) but may dilute the third (Meaning). When everything is too easily obtained, when happiness is low-hanging fruit, meaning often dissolves.

---

## Conclusion: Maintaining "Human" Bearing in an Ocean of Algorithms

Returning to the initial question. Entertainment in the AI era is an arms race for dopamine.

For corporations, this is a battle to harvest traffic by exploiting human weaknesses (greed, laziness, lust, loneliness), but also a technical upgrade leveraging human brilliance (creativity, curiosity, empathy). As product managers, we might be manufacturing top-tier "Electronic Heroin," but I hope we can instead create **"Electronic Nutrition."**

The future entertainment revolution should not merely addict us deeper into screens, but expand the boundaries of our life experience. If it is a zero-sum game, I hope we are not fighting for the time users spend zoning out, but for those moments when their eyes light up and they feel *"it's good to be alive."*

> *"In an era of artificial intelligence, real emotion becomes the ultimate luxury."*
